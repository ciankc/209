Cian Costello, Andrew Chen, Mrunal Patel

### Abstract 

### Project Timeline

* Week 4 - Project definition and abstract, literature review complete
* Week 5 - OpenSHS setup and data collection
* Week 6 - Use data to infer sensor locations
* Week 7 - Use data to recognize human activity patterns
* Week 8 - Use data to determine number of occupants
* Week 9 - Validate models (Kalman filter, Particle filter, Markov Chain etc)
* Week 10 - Finalize presentation and project report
