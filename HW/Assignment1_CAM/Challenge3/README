NOTES: 

generate-binary-file.sh and test-firmware-update.sh have been modified

Required programs/files/libraries:
gpg 
libgpgme or libgpgme-dev
a gpg public and private key pair in the following structure:
- private.key: the private key (needed)
- public.key: the public key (not really needed)
- public.gpg: the public key in binary format (needed)

If the only key you have in your keychain is private.key then public.gpg can be generated by running:
gpg --export > public.gpg

For simplicity, we have provided a default key pair (this is a terrible idea from a security standpoint)

RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Add private key to GPG Keychain

	gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import private.key

2) Generate the binary file
	
	bash generate-binary-file.sh

2) Test it
	
	bash test-firmware-update.sh
